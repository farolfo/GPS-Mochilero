# Hace dedo!

An open-source project to display hitchs of backpackers on live. Check it out at https://farolfo.github.io/GPS-Mochilero.

_Hace dedo!_ is a collaborative project. When travelling and being carried doing hitch on the road, mark it on the web app. This way we can calculate the bests roads and places for a backapacker to hitch!

## Application overview

The UI is pure javascript for now, using jQuery, underscore and google maps to deliver the data to the user as a heath map.

The API code is in [this Github repo](https://github.com/farolfo/mochilero-api) and hosted on heroku.
